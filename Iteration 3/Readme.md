## Step 1: Addressing Quality Attribute Scenario Driver (QA-3)
In this section, the results of the activities performed in each of the steps in the third iteration of the design process are presented. This iteration is used to build off of the fundamental decisions made in iteration 1 and 2, which leads to an important quality attribute scenario.

## Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal By Selecting Drivers
For this iteration, the architect focuses on the QA-3 scenario which sends location coordinates but shifts it slightly.

## Step 3: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine 
For this availability scenario, the elements that will be refined are the physical nodes that were identified during the second iteration:
- GeoLocation

## Step 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers
The design concepts used in this iteration are the following:

## Step 5: Instantiate Architectural Elements, Allocate Responsibilities, and Define Interfaces 
The instantiation design decisions are summarized in the following table: 

## Step 6: Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions
Figure 4.10 shows a refined deployment diagram that includes the introduction of redundancy in the system. 

## Step 7: Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration Goal and Achievement of Design Purpose
