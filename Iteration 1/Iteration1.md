## Iteration 1: Establishing an Overall System Structure
The focus of this section is to present the results of the activities that are performed in each of the steps in iteration 1 of the ADD design process. Step 2 till the end of step 7 will be focusing on iteration 1, where we will refine our requirements and quality attributes.

## Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers
This is the first iteration of the design of a USChat system, so the iteration goal is to establish the initial design of the system, where we will establish the overall system structure. This iteration will be driven by general architectural concerns, and there will be a focus on all the drivers that may further influence the general structure of the system. In particular, we will focus on items within:  
- QA-1: Scalability
- QA-3: Security
- QA-4: Performance
- QA-5: Availability
- CON-3: Users should be authenticated before joining the room
- CON-4: Network connection between user and server must have low bandwidth and be reliable
- CON-5: The system must be accessed through a web browser such as Chrome, Firefox Safari, etc.

## Step 3: Choose One or More Element to Refine
In this case, the element to refine is the entire USChat system. This refinement is performed through decomposition. 

## Step Four: Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers
