# SOFE 3650 Final Project Iteration 2: Identifying Structures to Support Primary Functionality
In this iteration, the architecture elements are revised and structures are identified to support the primary functionality.<br/>

The focus of this section is to present the results of the activities that are performed from each step of the ADD process in the second iteration. This iteration will dive deeper into more detailed decisions that will promote better implementation which will aid the development team. As we can not predict everything, we need to be more disciplined on which decisions we make and attack them from the most significant to least significant.

## Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers
The goal of this iteration is to address the general architectural concern of identifying structures to support primary functionality. Identifying these elements is important for understanding how functionality is supported and addressing CRN-3. 

Besides CRN-3, the architect considers the system’s primary use cases:
- UC-1: Store users
- UC-2: Send messages
- UC-6: Display users
- UC-9: Sending joining and leaving messages

## Step 3: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine
The elements that will be refined in this iteration are the modules located in the different layers defined by the three-tier reference architectures from the previous iteration. In general, the support of functionality in this system requires the collaboration of components associated with modules that are located in the different layers. 

## Step 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts that Satisfy the Selected Drivers
The following table summarizes the design decisions.

## Step 5: Instantiate Architectural Elements, Allocate Responsibilities, and Define Interfaces 
The instantiation design decisions made in this iteration are summarized in the following table:

## Step 6: Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions
As a result of the decisions made in step 5, the design decisions can be portrayed into several diagrams.
- The figure showcases an initial domain model for the system
- The figure shows the domain objects that are instantiated for the use case model in Section 

## Step 7: Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration Goal and Achievement of Design Purpose
The decisions made in this iteration provided an initial understanding of how the system shall function. The modules associated with the primary use cases were identified by the architect, and the modules associated with the rest of the functionality were identified by the rest of the team.
