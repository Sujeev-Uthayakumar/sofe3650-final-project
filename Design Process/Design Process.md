## The Design Process
This is the first part of the design process, we must translate the requirements and quality attributes that were previously gathered into design decisions. These design decisions will be derived from figure 1.2, which is a list of our quality attributes. This is the beginning of making design decisions that will allow for the development of the entire design of USChat.

## Review Inputs
The first step of the ADD method involves reviewing the inputs and identifying which requirements will be considered as drivers. The inputs for USChat are summarized in the table below.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Design Purpose | The purpose is to build a sufficiently detailed design to support the construction of the USChat program |
| Primary Functional Requirements | UC-1: Because it directly supports the core of the business <br/> UC-2: Because it directly supports the core of the business <br/> UC-6: Because it directly supports the core of the business <br/> UC-9: Because it directly supports the core of the business |
| Constraints | All the constraints discussed in system requirements will be included as drivers |
| Architectural Concerns | All the architectural concerns discussed in system requirements will be included as drivers |
